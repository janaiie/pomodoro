Pomodoro
Overview

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple Python application built using Tkinter that helps you manage your study sessions using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique encourages focused work intervals followed by short breaks, enhancing productivity and reducing burnout.

Features
    Customizable Work and Break Intervals: Set your preferred duration for work and break periods.
    Notifications: Get notified when a session ends.
    Simple and Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use interface for tracking your time.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Before running the Pomodoro Timer, ensure you have the following installed:
    Python: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
    Tkinter: Tkinter is included with Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.


Usage
    Setting Up
        Open the application.
        Set the Work Duration (e.g., 25 minutes).
        Set the Short Break Duration (e.g., 5 minutes).
        Set the Long Break Duration (e.g., 15 minutes) and the number of Pomodoros before a long break (e.g., 4).

    Starting a Session
        Click the Start button to begin a Pomodoro session.
        The timer will start counting down from your work duration.
        When the work session ends, a notification will alert you that it's time for a break.
        After the break, the timer will automatically start a new Pomodoro session if there are more sessions left.
